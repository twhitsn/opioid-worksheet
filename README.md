## To-do

- [X] Make "approach" dependent upon surgery type in form
- [X] Save file as PDF
- [X] Fix calendar svg sizing
- [X] Bring patient information and prescriber information inputs on the sheet.
- [X] Include inputs to set how long the prescription lasts and make it noticeable in the calendar.
- [ ] Label the border of the faces in the pain scale.
- [X] Second page fitting.
- [X] Second page include CDC illustrations.
- [X] Second page include CDC design.
- [X] Remember to say D3 instead of Dj3 or 3djs (my favorite). 

## Potential Extensions
- [ ] Include separately or in the same design the Physical Therapy illustrations.
   - [ ] This would require creating a bank of images.
- [ ] Error handling if incompatible fields are selected
- [ ] Error handling - start date before current day
- [ ] Timezone issues
- [ ] Should work in grayscale

## Technical

- [ ] Colors as global variable
- [ ] Form/worksheet does not clear properly
